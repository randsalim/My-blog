        <p>At March - July 2020, I started wondering about my future occupation, what I wanted to be. I started writing stories just like my mom, I found out that I'm just copying other books such as,harry Potter, Gerenimo Stilton and my mom's books. I have other plans like being a librarian, but it may go online, being a doctor, looks scary, and many more! I feel like maybe I should just leave that out and LATER I think about it(18 years old maybe?), when I'm sure what I like doing</p>
